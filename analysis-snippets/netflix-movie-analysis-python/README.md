# Movie Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the exploratory data analysis (EDA), cleaning, and transformation of a movie dataset. The goal is to uncover insights into movie characteristics, such as the distribution of genres, the categorization of audience voting averages, and trends in movie release dates.

## Data Source

The analysis is performed on the data contained in:
* `mymoviedb.csv`

The dataset is inferred to be a collection of movie metadata from a source like IMDb or The Movie Database (TMDb), containing features such as title, genre, popularity, vote counts, and release date.

## Dependencies

The analysis is conducted in a Python environment using a Jupyter Notebook. The following libraries are required:

* **pandas** (for data manipulation and cleaning)
* **numpy** (for numerical operations)
* **matplotlib** (for plotting)
* **seaborn** (for statistical data visualization)

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
