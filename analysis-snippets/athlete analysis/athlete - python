# 🏅 Olympic Athlete Events - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on exploring a comprehensive dataset of historical Olympic athlete event data. The analysis is performed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, demonstrating proficiency in data manipulation, cleaning, and visualization.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The primary objective of this project is to perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover interesting trends and patterns within the athlete events data.

## 🔬 Key Analysis & Insights

The analysis contained within the Jupyter Notebook focuses on key areas of the dataset, including:

* **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, checking data types, and preparing the raw data for analysis.
* **Athlete Demographics:** Exploring the distribution of athlete height, weight, and age across different games and sports.
* **Medal Distribution by City:** Calculating and visualizing the total number of medals (Gold, Silver, Bronze) awarded for each Olympic host city.
* **Historical Trends:** Analyzing how the number of athletes, events, and countries participating has changed over the history of the games.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Tool | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Python** | Primary programming language for data analysis. |
| **Jupyter Notebook** | Environment for interactive coding and presentation. |
| **Pandas** | Data manipulation and cleaning. |
| **NumPy** | Numerical operations and array handling. |
| **Matplotlib / Seaborn** | Data visualization for creating charts and graphs. |

## 📂 Repository Structure

* `athlete.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the Python code, analysis steps, and visualizations.
* `athlete_events.csv` (Assumed): The raw dataset required to run the notebook. *(Please ensure this file is included or provide instructions on where to download it).*

## 🚀 How to Run the Analysis

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YourUsername]/Athlete-EDA-Python.git
    cd Athlete-EDA-Python
    ```
2.  **Ensure Data is Present:** Place the `athlete_events.csv` file in the root directory.
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
    ```
4.  **Launch Jupyter:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook athlete.ipynb
    ```
5.  Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
